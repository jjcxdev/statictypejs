# XScript
XScript is a superset of JavaScript that emphasizes precise and explicit type management. In XScript, every numerical expression must be explicitly defined as either a string, enclosed in double quotes "", or as a number, prefixed with #. Failure to do so will result in a “Number type not defined” error, highlighting the language’s commitment to explicit type declaration. This document provides a comprehensive guide to the syntax, principles, and usage of XScript, with a focus on its unique approach to handling numeric types.

## 1. Introduction

XScript combines the simplicity of JavaScript with enhanced type safety. This language aims to reduce the verbosity often associated with type-safe languages like TypeScript, while providing a more robust framework for handling types, especially numeric literals.
